# Route-Mapping
In recent days, transportation applications to move from one place to another has been evolving rapidly. The use of data from many users helps to make transportation better. Especially in reducing transportation time and avoid heavy traffic roads. In this project, you are asked to find the least time to move from the source location to the destination location. And to find the path that achieves that time. The map is represented as a graph. Intersections are represented by nodes and roads are represented by edges. Each road has a speed (in km/h). You may assume that all the vehicles moving at the road are moving with that speed. The moving person can walk for at most R meters from the source location to get to the starting intersection. Then they ride a vehicle to move to another intersection close to the destination location. Then they can walk from the intersection to the destination location for at most R meters. The walking speed is always 5 km/h (from the source location to the nearby intersection and from the intersection near to the destination to the destination location).
